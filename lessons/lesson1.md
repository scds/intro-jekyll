A small description about the lesson.

<!-- This is your table of contents. You don't need to touch it, it automatically creates it when you add or remove headers. If you do not want a header to be included, put {: .no_toc } above the header line, as you can see above with Lesson 1 - Lesson Name. Make sure that there's also an empty line above {: .no_toc }... Markdown is picky about this :( -->
<details markdown="block" class="toc">
